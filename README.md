# Co-Pilot Demo
 This repo is designed to demonstrate GitHub Co-Pilot.

 Use the file: webscrape and char - Codeless.py
 This file only contains comments, which Co-Pilot will be able to use and build code to read an API, import the data and produce a chart.
 A coded version is also included, which has been written soley from the comments by Co-Pilot.

 A game.py file exists that has requirements for a game of Snake that Co-Pilot will use to try and create.

 For demonstrational purposes.
