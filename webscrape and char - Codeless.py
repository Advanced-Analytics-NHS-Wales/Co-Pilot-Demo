#This is a demo for github co-pilot showing how it can be used to help create a script that will build a chart from an external websource.
#The comments are prewritten to demonstrate how co-pilot can be used to help write code based on them.

#Import Packages for requesting url, handling data frames and creating charts from data frames

#URL http://open.statswales.gov.wales/en-gb/dataset/HLTH0091
#This is the url for the data set that we will be using to build the chart

#Request the url and store the response in a variable called response as JSON

#convert to dictionary

#process dictionary into a data frame based on the value column

#print the data frame first 5 rows

#convert Data column to numeric value for plotting

#plot the the columns Date_ItemName_ENG as x axis and Data as y axis, and filter Indicator_Hierarchy  by Misc_Admissions_All
#Title it "GITHUB COPILOT DEMO"
#Label the x axis "Date"

#export the result to a png file
