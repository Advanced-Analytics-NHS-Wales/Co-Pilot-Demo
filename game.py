#This script is to show how a game can be made with co-pilot with nothing but comments.

#the game to be developed is a game of snake, it will have keyboard control and display in a window for the user to see.
#there will be a dot that appears that the play must control a snake towards. The snake is a series of blocks that follow the head.
#the snake will grow in length as it eats the dot. The game will end if the snake hits the wall or itself.
#the game will have a score counter that will increase as the snake eats the dot.
